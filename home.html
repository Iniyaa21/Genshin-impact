        <p>Hey! I am <b>Iniyaa</b>!! Nothing extraordinary about me, just a normal, boring person (this is where you should say "No Iniyaa, you are <b>NOT</b> boring!!"...No? Never mind then). Alright, this is the Home page guys. What is in the next page, you ask? Its a mystery....</p>
        <p>I know this whole website is gonna seem like I am over obsessed with this game called <b>Genshin Impact</b>. I am pretty sure you won't understand literally anything that I have put but hey, I had tons of fun making this (although finding and downloading all those images made me wanna throw my laptop across the room several times). So, enjoy!!</p>
